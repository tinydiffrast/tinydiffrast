# Tinydiffrast
Tinydiffrast is a differentiable rasterizer developped for educational purposes by [Jordan Bannister](https://github.com/JJBannister) while at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), and in collaboration with [Derek Nowrouzezahrai](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/) from the McGill Graphics Lab. The project aims to explore, explain, and implement state of the art approaches to differentiable triangle rasterization. 

Documentation and lessons can be found on the [**project wiki**](https://github.com/tinydiffrast/tinydiffrast/wiki/tinydiffrast).
